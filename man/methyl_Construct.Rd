\description{
This function allows you to associate DNA methylation with matched mRNA
expression. There are three methods to choose from: 'Adjusted' in which
one can adjust for race, 'Interaction' in which one can enforce a weak hierarchy
and include race interaction terms, and 'Specific' in which one can associate
in a race-specific manner.
